1) First lab work:
Build and train a model that reads ESC-50 dataset sounds and classifies them into 50 categories.

2) Second lab work:
Using a pre-trained model create a classifier for images as well as draw a rectangle, showing object's location in the image.

3) Third lab work:
Scrape thousands of articles and extract their features using a longformer model. Then using the extracted features, create a article search engine which return the most similar article from the dataset in contrast to the provided one.
